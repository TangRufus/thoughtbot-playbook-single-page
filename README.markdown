# Thoughtbot Playbook on One Page

This quick and dirty Ruby script pulls down the pages of Thoughtbot's Playbook
from <http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/> and generates a single-page HTML version
of the content.

To run:

      ruby playbook.rb

This will generate the playbook in file called `out.html`.

Pleaes fork and improve at will.
