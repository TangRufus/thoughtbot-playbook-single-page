<h1 id="getting_started">Getting started</h1>

<p>Team, business model, product idea, wireframes… where to begin?</p>

<p>We like it when our clients start by <a href="#customer_discovery">discovering their customers</a>.</p>

<p>Some clients have a clearly defined product <a href="#vision">vision</a>. However, we expect the original feature set to change upon first contact with customers. So, we prefer working without extensive requirements.</p>

<p>Instead, we ask for <a href="#user_stories">user stories</a> and low-fidelity <a href="#sketches">sketches</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, we urge our clients to consider user experience and unique data as their <a href="#strengths">greatest strengths</a>.</p>

<hr>
<div><a name="getting_started_customer_discovery_"></a></div>
<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">Make plans</span> &gt; <span>Getting started</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="customer_discovery">Customer discovery</h1>

<p>The riskiest thing a company can do is make something no one wants. So “get outside the building.” It costs $0.</p>

<ul>
<li>Talk to customers to figure out their problems.</li>

<li>Build a minimal product.</li>

<li>Iterate until the product solves the problems really well.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s harder than it sounds and it’s not formulaic. At all times, we have to use our judgment as humans because other humans are good at describing their problems but bad at describing what solution they need.</p>

<p>In addition to getting out of the building and talking to people in person, consider running surveys. <span>Google Forms</span> (free) is a fast and easy way to create them, distribute them, and run simple reports on the results.</p>

<h2 id="right_action_right_time">Right action, right time</h2>

<p>Don’t worry about viral landing pages or viral private betas at this point. Those are acquisition and referral techniques that should wait until we’ve figured out how to make users happy.</p>

<p>A handful of “friendly first contacts” can be all you need to test your hypotheses early on. Collecting thousands of emails won’t help you learn faster.</p>

<p>As you encircle the thing people want, round up a couple dozen more people to help find nasty bugs or confusing interfaces and flows that you can’t see anymore because you’re too close to the product. This is a good “private beta” or invite-only time period.</p>

<p>When you launch publicly, <em>then</em> you put up a landing page where people can <em>actually sign up for the real thing with their email address</em>. You’ll get a very similar set of people signing up when you launch than you would during that interim period when you’re in private beta.</p>

<h2 id="customer_validation">Customer validation</h2>

<p>Can this be a profitable business?</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch with a simple sign up landing page</li>

<li>Make a few tweaks based on early feedback</li>

<li>Get people talking about the product</li>
</ul>
<p>Most startups never exit the customer validation phase. It can be difficult to make <a href="#profitably_running_saas">the economics</a> work.</p>

<h2 id="variance">Variance</h2>

<p>Our projects vary widely in popularity but the quality of the software is usually the same. We think the variance is due to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intensity of the problem</li>

<li>Size of the market</li>

<li>Ability to reach the market</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of our clients do not have a big marketing budget. They sometimes get good press, which is only a temporary boost in traffic. Rarely do we see companies who are great at customer acquisition.</p>

<h2 id="getting_people_talking_about_the_product">Getting people talking about the product</h2>

<p>A low-cost, long-term strategy is <span>Inbound Marketing</span>.</p>

<p>The idea is to create content to attract people Googling for solutions to their problems and to get people talking about, or even advocating for, you on social media. It’s not intrusive like advertising and provides a slower, longer-term trickle of traffic.</p>

<h2 id="case_study_dropbox">Case study: Dropbox</h2>

<p>While they’re not a client of ours, we regularly use <span>Dropbox</span> for our contracts, design assets, etc. They also shared their <span>customer discovery story</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li>3-minute screencast, posted to Hacker News. Got 50 comments.</li>

<li>Simple landing page. Posted link to Digg. Collected 75,000 email addresses. Good sign of interest.</li>

<li>After-launch landing page was simple. Call to action obvious. Nothing much to read.</li>

<li>Hooked the user on core functionality first. Educated over time via tip emails.</li>

<li>Referral program increased signups 60%.</li>

<li>Contact list (Gmail) importer drove 3 million invites over 30 days.</li>
</ul>

<span class="tier-one">Make plans</span> &gt; <span>Getting started</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="vision">Vision</h1>

<p>Why do these products exist?</p>

<ol>
<li>Young professionals are tired after working all day but need to eat dinner.</li>

<li>Parents and spouses want to take care of their families and not have delivery every night.</li>

<li>Military families have gear that other military families need.</li>
</ol>
<p>How will these products solve those problems?</p>

<ol>
<li>College students and single professionals order dinner to be delivered from local restaurants.</li>

<li>Family caretakers watch HD video from experienced chefs.</li>

<li>Military families buy and sell their stuff on an eBay-style marketplace private to their community.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once we know users’ stories and the founders’ high-level vision, everything else falls into place.</p>

<h2 id="one_visionary">One visionary</h2>

<p>A single person should be caretaker of the product vision. Usually, it’s one of the startup’s founders.</p>

<p>We, the designers and developers, depend on that person to run interference on investors, family members, friends, customers, or others who try and push the product around.</p>

<h2 id="from_the_heart">From the heart</h2>

<p>All other things being equal, we like to be inspired by the vision and work for <span>startups from the heart</span>.</p>

<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">Make plans</span> &gt; <span>Getting started</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="user_stories">User stories</h1>

<p>Once we’ve identified a subset of customers’ problems to solve next, we write user stories and enter them into <span>Trajectory</span> or another product management tool.</p>

<p>User stories are written in a short, 3-part format:</p>

<pre><code>As a [user role]
I want to [goal]
so that [reason]</code></pre>

<p>There are no technical or interface details. Our clients prioritize the stories. We estimate the difficulty of the story on a scale of:</p>

<pre><code>1, 2, 4, or 8 points</code></pre>

<p>Points are relative to each other, and specific to a project. An eight point story is the largest possible item you can imagine that can’t be broken down further into smaller features. A one point story is the smallest possible task you can imagine.</p>

<p>Stories that are bigger than eight points are too complex and should be broken into smaller pieces.</p>
<span></span>
<p>If a related discussion, user story, bug, or todo comes up, create it separately and paste a link to it in the comment. Trajectory will format and display it nicely.</p>

<h1 id="sketches">Sketches</h1>

<p>When designing a user interface, it helps to… design the interface.</p>

<p>This is a collaborative process from the team, not just the purview of those who know how to wield HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

<p>Paper (or a whiteboard, or an iPad sketching app) is a low-cost, effective way to quickly iterate through a ton of interface ideas. You can run usability tests on the paper prototypes.</p>

<p>Consider investing $15-25 on a <span>Moleskine large soft square notebook</span>. A great habit is carrying it with you frequently so that you can get ideas onto paper whenever and wherever they hit you.</p>

<h1 id="strengths">Strengths</h1>

<p>What do you think the most sustainable competitive advantages are for web products today? How about:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="#user_experience">user experience</a> and</li>

<li>unique data</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider Twitter and Foursquare. Etsy and Kickstarter. Quora and Instagram. Amazon and Netflix.</p>

<p>Their go-to-market strategy followed the <span>thin edge of the wedge</span> pattern. They focused on a small subset of features. Designing a valuable user experience came first.</p>

<p>They developed a meaningful relationship with their customers. In the process, they created incredibly valuable unique data sets.</p>

<p>Competitors can copy their operations or their look and feel. They can reverse-engineer their systems. But they’ll be derivatives of the original and consumers are too savvy to settle for copycats.</p>

<h2 id="differentiation_is_overrated">Differentiation is overrated</h2>

<p>Think about those products again. Twitter was called a “micro-blogging” service by the press for a long time. However, the vision for it was never “like blogging, but shorter.”</p>

<p>It was more like a ”<span>real-time SMS dispatch system</span>.”</p>

<p>We hear a lot of product pitches that are “like X, but with Y twist.” Most of the times, the twist is a superficial difference.</p>

<p>Instead of being different, those products cared about their own users, solving a problem in their own way, and trying to make their own product better.</p>

<p>“If you can not measure it, you can not improve it.” – Lord Kelvin</p>

<h1 id="defining_actionable_metrics">Defining actionable metrics</h1>

<p>Here’s what we want to measure:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="#aarrr">AARRR</a>: the high-level metrics framework</li>

<li>
<a href="#viral_coefficient">Viral coefficient</a>: can this grow organically?</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t take long to get started, and it’s costly to reconstruct historical measurements. Get started earlier rather than later.</p>

<p>Consider logging <em>every interesting event</em> and <em>every interesting property</em> along with each event, especially referrer. If unique data is one of the <a href="#strengths">greatest strengths</a> of a web startup, then we need to record the data in a methodical way.</p>

<h2 id="how_to_measure">How to measure</h2>

<p><span>KISSmetrics</span> costs but is worth it. Set up AARRR metrics and use it as a dashboard. Build signup and engagement funnels to see where your biggest dropoffs are, and target your optimization. It has out-of-the-box support for SaaS-specific events and metrics. It shows A/B test results across your funnels. It knows when users were referred by ad campaigns.</p>

<p>Google Analytics is free. Use it to identify traffic sources.</p>

<p>Look for gaps in what off-the-shelf tools provide and don’t be afraid to write your own data dashboards. <span>Jack Dorsey has recommended this</span> and Square apparently has a statistic that is “how many times has someone looked at the data dashboard?” which shows you how much they care about data.</p>

<h2 id="rules_of_thumb">Rules of thumb</h2>

<p>Here are some typical numbers you can use to save yourself spreadsheet and research time:</p>

<ul>
<li>10% conversion home page to free trial</li>

<li>10% conversion from free trial to paid plan</li>

<li>1% conversion from free forever to paid plan</li>

<li>$100,000/year cost per employee</li>

<li>30% of registered users (or number of downloads if a mobile app) will use the service each month</li>

<li>10% of registered users (or number of downloads if a mobile app) will use the service each day</li>

<li>10% of daily users is equal to the max number of concurrent users of a real-time service</li>
</ul>

<span class="tier-one">II. Make plans</span> &gt; <span>Defining actionable metrics</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="aarrr">AARRR</h1>

<p>Dave McClure’s <span>Startup Metrics for Pirates</span> is a good framework for thinking about macro metrics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acquisition</li>

<li>Activation</li>

<li>Retention</li>

<li>Revenue</li>

<li>Referral</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on them in this order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Activation, Retention (happiness)</li>

<li>Revenue (sustainability)</li>

<li>Acquisition, Referral (virality)</li>
</ol>
<p>This order is the <span>Ash Maurya</span> or 37signals order: charge from day one.</p>

<p>Most of our clients are early stage, focused on getting a product built that makes customers happy and keeps them around. That means we want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instrument a dashboard</li>

<li>Gauge customer happiness</li>

<li>Test customer adoption (# of users, # paying)</li>

<li>Automate emails after sign up (3 days no activity, 30 days free trial ending)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example of a marketing dashboard for <span>pbb.fm</span>:</p>
<img src="https://thoughtbot-handbook.s3.amazonaws.com/aarrr.png" alt="Marketing dashboard"><p>Once customers love the product and know what conversion rates currently are, we’ll help you optimize conversion and build referral mechanisms into the app at points immediately <strong>after</strong> users have a happy experience.</p>

<p>At that point, we can help you measure a <a href="#viral_coefficient">viral growth coefficient</a>. If it’s greater than 1.0, you have a hit on your hands:</p>

<pre><code>X * Y * Z</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>X = % of users who invite other people</li>

<li>Y = average # of people they invited</li>

<li>Z = % of users who accepted an invitation</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, drive referrals <em>after</em> users have a happy experience.</p>

<hr>
<div><a name="defining_actionable_metrics_viral_coefficient_"></a></div>
<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">Make plans</span> &gt; <span>Defining actionable metrics</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="viral_coefficient">Viral coefficient</h1>

<pre><code>I * CR = K

I = Invitations
CR = conversion rate of invitations
K = viral coefficient</code></pre>

<p>For “viral growth”, we need a viral coefficient greater than 1.</p>

<p>You’ll sometimes hear people call the viral coefficient the <span>K-factor</span>.</p>

<h2 id="built_into_the_product">Built into the product</h2>

<p>Viral growth cannot be executed by a marketing department that can’t code. It has to be built into the product by developers. We want outcomes like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active, happy users invite many new users</li>

<li>Active, happy users share lots of our app’s content</li>

<li>Active, happy users use the app longer</li>
</ul>
<p>To get a viral coefficient of 1 or better, we might need numbers as good as:</p>

<ul>
<li>10% of users to invite their friends</li>

<li>10 invitations per user</li>

<li>10 content shares per user</li>

<li>10% of users active every day</li>

<li>10 repeat visits per user every month</li>

<li>10% of invitations to be accepted</li>
</ul>
<p>That should sound hard. To achieve those numbers, we might want to use these techniques:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single-step invite flows</li>

<li>Encourage users to invite friends or share content only at times when user is happiest or really wants to take another action (“To see this video, invite 3 friends.”).</li>

<li>Address book importers</li>

<li>User-to-user messaging</li>

<li>Collaborative filtering for content recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are things that developers have to implement, not traditional marketers. Great copy and calls to action are still important, but the viral mechanisms have become engineering tasks.</p>

<h1 id="building_a_team">Building a team</h1>

<p>This is a typical dilemma for folks trying to get a web business going:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I find a technical co-founder?</li>

<li>Should I hire a freelancer? A development firm?</li>

<li>Should I try to build something myself?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the_goal">The goal</h2>

<p>A <a href="#roles">perfect team</a> in our opinion is a visionary, a designer, and a developer. The muscles necessary to success are already developed and in-house. Everyone is <span>T-shaped</span>, with a depth of expertise and ability to collaborate cross-discipline.</p>

<p>Earlier stage companies tend to employ generalists. In order to move quickly, team members have to be <strong>ambidextrous</strong>. We sometimes refer to this concept as “Everybody codes”, and discuss it in our Web Design and Development Process workshop.</p>

<h2 id="getting_there">Getting there</h2>

<p>If you don’t have a designer and/or a developer on your founding team, you could <a href="#outsourcing">hire someone</a>. This is a good option if you’re ready to build something right now. The tradeoff is you need to manage the relationship and that’s not easy.</p>

<p>A great way to use consultants to your advantage is to have them teach you how <a href="#do_it_yourself">do it yourself</a> while they build early versions of the product. Our clients sometimes attend our <span>workshops</span> and pair program with us on their product.</p>

<p>If you’ve been working with consultants and the business becomes profitable or you raise money, you’ll have built the muscles:</p>

<ul>
<li>know how pros build products</li>

<li>have relationships with folks in the industry</li>

<li>have a better eye for <a href="#hiring">talent</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>What does the ideal web team look like?</p>

<p>There’s <span>a good thread on Quora</span> on the subject. One of the catchier responses was “Hacker, Hustler, Designer”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The designer is customer facing and solving the customer problems, the hacker is hacking, and the hustler is in search of the business model.</p>

<p>Our approach is similar. Our clients play the role of “hustler”, initiating the project after <a href="#customer_discovery">developing customers</a>.</p>

<p>On the thoughtbot side, most of our project teams consist of 2 developers and 1 designer. One of the three team members acts as lead. An advisor assists the team for a few hours a week.</p>

<h2 id="lead">Lead</h2>

<p>The lead is responsible for the direction and organization of the project. They are either a designer or developer.</p>

<p>The buck stops here. The success or failure of the project ultimately rests on the lead’s shoulders. It’s up to them to make the hard decisions, to delegate to others when they don’t have the time or skill to accomplish a task, and to keep team morale up.</p>

<h2 id="designer">Designer</h2>

<p>The designer is responsible for designing a <a href="#user_experience">total customer experience</a>. They think through all the interaction points between customers and the product. They attempt to evoke emotions in users of the product and then monitor whether their attempts hit the mark.</p>

<p>Assisting users to experience an emotion and understand content is a manipulation of the user’s behavior. So, the designer keeps in mind the values the product is projecting.</p>

<p>They also implement. They write and maintain HTML and CSS code.</p>

<h2 id="developers">Developers</h2>

<p>The developers make it work. They write the code that makes the app “smart.” They aim to make the product error-free. They <a href="#performance_monitoring">monitor performance</a> because speed is a feature of every application.</p>

<p>They keep it running. They make architectural decisions and interact with modern-day hosting companies like <span>Heroku</span> or <span>Blue Box Group</span>, whose employees double as your outsourced operations team.</p>

<p>The developers also implement. They write and maintain HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, SQL, and lots of other code. They set and meet development standards, keep the Continuous Integration build passing, and review each others’ code.</p>

<h2 id="advisor">Advisor</h2>

<p>The advisor is an impartial counselor. They facilitate weekly retrospectives and counsel both the thoughtbot team and the client.</p>

<p>The advisor also helps the rest of the team see how they look from an outside perspective. They express enthusiasm when the team is in a groove and serious guidance when things get off track.</p>

<p>The advisor is usually <span>Chad</span>, <span>Matt</span>, or <span>Dan</span>.</p>

<h2 id="everyone">Everyone</h2>

<p>While each person plays a role, a team needs to be a team.</p>

<p>Everyone takes initiative every day: for delivering high quality work, for staying true to <a href="#vision">the vision</a> for the product, for communicating their schedule and intentions, and for being consistent.</p>

<p>Nothing builds trust like doing what you said you would.</p>

<span class="tier-one">II. Make plans</span> &gt; <span>Building a team</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="outsourcing">Outsourcing</h1>

<p>Here’s a secret. Good consultants can be really helpful, but they’re expensive. The way to get the most out of consultants is to have them to teach you how to do what they do.</p>

<p>thoughtbot and others, like <span>Pivotal Labs</span>, make it a core part of our offering to teach the founders how to design and develop with our toolset. Or, we can help hire your team, pair programming with them on the product to ease the transition.</p>

<p>When you outsource, you can hire your team slowly. The product is getting built, you’re learning what customers like and dislike about it, and you might even (shock) be bringing revenue in.</p>

<p>There’s no unnecessary urgency to hire before you’re ready, or perhaps the cardinal sin of business, make the wrong hire.</p>

<h2 id="look_local_first">Look local first</h2>

<p>Creating a web product that matters to its users is difficult. Trying to work with a team across a vast geographical and maybe spoken language difference raises the degree of difficulty.</p>

<p>We highly value <a href="#face_time">face time</a>. As tempting as the savings may look, we don’t recommend hiring a distant team.</p>

<p>Most of our clients are local to Boston. If you’re in San Francisco, New York, or Boulder, consider Pivotal. Chicago or Jacksonville: <span>Hashrocket</span>. Ohio: <span>Edgecase</span>. Indiana: <span>Ordered List</span>. Michigan: <span>Collective Idea</span>. Portland Oregon: <span>Planet Argon</span>. etc.</p>

<h2 id="elance_and_odesk">Elance and oDesk</h2>

<p>Sites like Elance and oDesk can connect you with many cheap developers around the world. Sometimes those developers are quite skilled. You might be tempted to augment the team with those developers and have them write modular code, such as a web service that interacts with your main app.</p>

<p>In practice, the communication overhead between you and the freelancer, and between the freelancer and your existing developers, ends up eating into the cost savings.</p>

<h2 id="99designs">99designs</h2>

<p>Similarly, 99designs can connect you with many cheap designers around the world. Sometimes those designers are quite skilled. These look like great resources for certain tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>designing business cards, stationary, other documents that a small number of your partners see</li>

<li>designing a logo</li>
</ul>
<p>We can recommend them for the business documents use case.</p>

<p>We recommend delaying work on a logo as long as possible. Have the designer pick a nice typeface to set your product’s name in and use that as the logo for now.</p>

<p>Again, the danger is communication overhead between you and the freelancer, and between the freelancer and your existing developers. With user-facing design, there’s also the added danger of losing consistency in the <a href="#visual_design">visual design</a>.</p>

<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">II. Make plans</span> &gt; <span>Building a team</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="do_it_yourself">Do it yourself</h1>

<p>As <span>Antonio Rodriguez</span> of Matrix Partners says, <span>everybody codes</span>.</p>

<p>In the early days of a two or three person startup, you’re either making the product or talking to customers. Nothing else matters until the startup has reached product/market fit.</p>

<p>It’s easier to code than you think. It’s 2012 and there is plenty of great <a href="#preparing_production_environment">technology</a> available that have solved lower-level problems. You don’t need to hire someone to do it all.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to hire someone until you’ve tried to do their job for a little while. It’s hard to know which questions to ask and how to identify quality. And those first few hires are critical. Learn to speak (well, code) the language and you’ll lower your hiring risk.</p>

<p>There’s an incredible <span>shortage</span> of developers in San Francisco, New York, and Boston. Making progress yourself is a way to endear yourself to top talent and get them hired.</p>

<p>Your coding doesn’t have to be perfect. If you’re developing the early prototype, it doesn’t have to scale and doesn’t need to be totally secure. The CTO you’ll hire later will re-write it, anyway.</p>

<p>If you’re part of an early 2-5 person team, <span>everyone has to be generalist</span>. That means if you want a layout changed, do it with CSS. If you want to run a report, do it with SQL.</p>

<p>Better than interrupting designers or developers during <span>maker time</span>.</p>

<p>Ask for privileges to commit to production with git, then earn it.</p>

<hr>
<div><a name="building_a_team_hiring_"></a></div>
<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">II. Make plans</span> &gt; <span>Building a team</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="hiring">Hiring</h1>

<p>Many of our clients consist of a founding team without a CTO-type figure. We know how crucial this hire is and have heard concerns from people that they can’t evaluate that person’s technical abilities.</p>

<p>We interview and give hiring recommendations.</p>

<p>A good software consultant should approach your team building just like product building. We want to make ourselves redundant. We don’t want to create a dependency on ourselves.</p>

<p>If you’re not working with us, pay a friend of yours who is the best developer you know to run an interview.</p>

<h2 id="finding_candidates_via_open_source">Finding candidates via open source</h2>

<p>We wrote an open source “email and password” authentication library for Ruby on Rails called <span>Clearance</span>. A couple of years ago, we got some excellent patches from <span>Josh</span>. We contacted him to say thank you, which eventually led to hiring him.</p>

<h2 id="bringing_global_talent_to_boston">Bringing global talent to Boston</h2>

<p>While Josh’s contributions were the trigger for finding him, a candidate’s GitHub account is always a factor in our hiring process, and it allows us to look globally. Due in part to their open source work, we’ve recently hired great people from Michigan, Louisiana, Georgia, and Thailand.</p>

<h2 id="user_groups">User groups</h2>

<p>Many of us are regulars at <a href="#events">Boston user groups</a> for web design, Ruby, Javascript, DevOps, Android, NoSQL, and software craftsmanship. There’s an amazing culture of sharing and learning at their events and on their mailing lists. The members are involved voluntarily.</p>

<p>We met <span>Harold</span> at Boston Ruby events. He <span>committed code to the group project</span>, answered questions about cron in the group’s IRC channel, and was enjoyable to be around. When he gave a <span>killer presentation on Postgres</span>, we knew we had to see if he was interested in working with us.</p>

<h2 id="no_surprises">No Surprises</h2>

<p>You know what you’ll get when you hire in the above ways. You know their personality and energy level from the user group. You know their coding style from their open source work. You know they’ll take initiative because they voluntarily contributed to the community. You know they have a desire to get better because they’re there listening every month and asking questions.</p>

<h2 id="naturally">Naturally</h2>

<p>Another nice thing about this process is that it happens naturally. We’re not trolling GitHub looking for people or fishing for talent at user groups. We’re there, anyway. If we never hired again, we’d still be writing and using open source. We’d be members of mailing lists and going to events.</p>

<h2 id="finding_candidates_online">Finding candidates online</h2>

<p>The two places online that you’ll find good developers and designers are GitHub and Dribbble. <span>GitHub has a job board</span>.</p>

<p>You can also find users by location on both services. Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>GitHub users who write Ruby in Boston</span></li>

<li><span>Dribbble users in Boston</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Each service doubles as a community and have their own sets of standards of etiquette. For Dribbble, for instance, if you want to contact a member about a job, only message those who have <span>displayed âHire Meâ</span> on their profiles.</p>

<h2 id="the_pair_programming_interview">The pair programming interview</h2>

<p>Doing things naturally extends to the interview process. We have candidates work out of our Boston office for 2-5 days (depending on how much time they can spare). They pair program with our folks, as much of the team as possible, and to be hired must get a unanimous “yes.” We pay the candidate for their time ($200/day) and any travel expenses. This isn’t cheap but it’s fair.</p>

<p>We do the interviews this way because there’s no substitute for seeing someone actually do the work and interacting with the team. We also want candidates to experience what the company’s like in our Boston office because we request that everyone work there.</p>

<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">II. Make plans</span> &gt; <span>Building a team</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="face_time">Face time</h1>

<p>We’ve set up our office so that our clients work at the same cluster of desks as our teams. Nothing beats in-person communication.</p>

<p>Tools like <span>Campfire</span> and <span>Trajectory</span> are great when you need them, but we could never feel comfortable with a totally distributed team. We understand people do it successfully, but we feel it raises the degree of difficulty unnecessarily.</p>

<p>We’re fortunate to live in a city like Boston that is teeming with talented people. However, making the decision to have a strictly co-located team has the interesting ramification that eventually, you have to attract people to your city.</p>

<p>Particularly via the open source community, we’ve done just that, <span>hiring great people</span> from Michigan, Louisiana, Georgia, and Thailand.</p>

<hr>
<div><a name="choosing_platforms_"></a></div>
<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">Set up infrastructure</span> &gt; </div>
<h1 id="choosing_platforms">Choosing platforms</h1>

<p>Very early, we have to decide on which platforms we’ll depend.</p>

<p>The answer depends on our ideas for solving these users’ problems. For example, if they’re construction workers on a job site, a mobile or tablet interface might be the best choice.</p>

<p>After considering what’s best for users, what’s best for us?</p>

<ul>
<li>The tools are open source with a strong community</li>

<li>The tools make the designers and developers happy</li>

<li>The tools make it easy to create and iterate quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>Open source (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, UNIX, vim, Postgres, Redis, etc) tends to be higher-quality software that is on the cutting edge of technology and best practices. It also helps avoid vendor lock-in.</p>

<p>Tools that make makers happy will make them more productive.</p>

<p>Web applications lend themselves to creating and iterating quickly. We’re able to deploy multiple times a day. We can record users’ actions in real-time to make adjustments for them. We don’t need to go through an approval process (like the App Store) or deal with the vagaries of customers’ machines (like desktop software).</p>

<p>For these reasons, we regularly choose these platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#web_apps">Web apps</a></li>

<li><a href="#mobile_apps">Mobile apps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To make those apps, we choose among a subset of platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#programming_languages">Programming languages</a></li>

<li><a href="#frameworks">Frameworks</a></li>

<li><a href="#databases">Databases</a></li>

<li><a href="#software_licenses">Software licenses</a></li>

<span class="tier-one">III. Set up infrastructure</span> &gt; <span>Choosing platforms</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="web_apps">Web apps</h1>

<p>In our experience, <span>Ruby on Rails</span> web apps tend to be fast to market and have a low total cost of ownership.</p>

<p>We don’t have <span>quantitive data</span> to prove it’s “the fastest and cheapest”, but have some theories why it’s at least “fast and cheap”:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s highly conventional. One Rails app’s codebase looks very similar to other Rails app’s codebases.</li>

<li>There’s a strong relationship between agile and Ruby communities. Ruby developers tend to be “test-infected” and work hard to avoid repeated code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe the greatest compliment we can pay to Rails is that we’ve made a huge financial commitment to it, essentially betting the future of the company on it in 2005. We’re still here.</p>

<p>In return, we’re proud of our contributions to the community, in particular our <span>open source libraries</span> and frequent articles on our blog, <span>Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots</span>.</p>

<h2 id="open_source_and_web_standards">Open source and web standards</h2>

<p>Use open source software (OSS) and web standards such as HTTP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>High quality – these tools have been built by people who need them to solve their own problems</li>

<li>Avoid vendor lock-in – no one owns the tech or can steer it in a direction that you don’t want to follow</li>

<li>Flexibility to switch components – clean interfaces lead to interchangeable parts</li>

<li>Works on many devices – projects are typically used by people who need it work on their own platform/hardware</li>

<li>Battle-tested – OSS projects are constantly thrown up against the needs of actual real world problems</li>

<li>Security, all bugs are shallow when seen by many eyes – thousands of people want the project to function flawlessly</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who_uses_rails">Who uses Rails?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>

<li>Groupon</li>

<li>Amazon</li>

<li>The New York Times</li>

<li>And <span>many moreâ¦</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>Ruby on Rails comes with features that decrease the burden on the programmer to protect against security attacks such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>cross-site scripting (XSS)</li>

<li>cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</li>

<li>SQL injection</li>

<li>header injection</li>

<li>sensitive data in logs</li>
</ul>
<p>While Rails makes “doing the right thing” easy, developers are still required to be diligent, knowledgeable, and test comprehensively. For more information, see the <span>Ruby on Rails Security Guide</span>.</p>

<h2 id="browser_support_or_the_scourge_of_ie6">Browser support (or “The scourge of IE6”)</h2>

<p>We recommend that you support IE 7.0+, Firefox 3.0+, Chrome 4.0+, and Safari 3.0+.</p>

<p>We do not support IE6. Instead, those users see a polite message showing them how to upgrade. Why?</p>

<p>Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) is famously “different” and “broken.” It is 9 years old and <span>losing market share</span> fast. Google Apps has <span>stopped supporting it</span>. Apple <span>does not support it</span> in their MobileMe product. Microsoft will stop supporting it in <span>2014</span>. It has <span>security issues</span>.</p>

<p>Most of all, it is time-consuming to design for, develop for, and support it. It adds an expensive overhead to each feature. You will notice a considerable increase in project cost if you want us to build in support for older browsers, including IE6.</p>

<hr>
<div><a name="choosing_platforms_mobile_apps_"></a></div>
<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">III. Set up infrastructure</span> &gt; <span>Choosing platforms</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="mobile_apps">Mobile apps</h1>

<p>The first thing most people ask when talking about mobile is “native or mobile web”? That might be the wrong question.</p>

<p>Consider this: “mobile” refers to the user, not the technology.</p>

<p>Everything about how you design a mobile application has to be in the context of that idea. It raises questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are they moving?</li>

<li>Are they relaxed on a couch?</li>

<li>How dexterous are their fingers?</li>
</ul>
<p>In many ways, “mobile” just means “small screen.” We have to become the Hemingway of copywriting, staying concise in content and calls to actions.</p>

<p>The second thing people like to focus on is market share of Android phones vs. iPhones vs. Blackberries, etc. Again, this isn’t as important as “who is your target audience?”</p>

<h2 id="mobile_web_apps">Mobile web apps</h2>

<p>We recommend using <span>jQuery Mobile</span> if you’re going to develop a mobile web app.</p>

<p>One thing all modern “smart” phones have in common is the ability to render HTML. For most apps, mobile web is therefore a good place to start. A mobile web app affords advantages like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create and iterate quickly.</li>

<li>Deploy new versions multiple times a day.</li>

<li>Reach the broadest possible audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people also don’t realize that HTML5 is making features available that were previously only available “natively”:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#location_awareness">GPS (geo-location)</a></li>

<li><span>Accelerometer</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This trend will continue. In coming years, expect other previously “native” elements to be available from mobile web apps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Camera</li>

<li>Calendar</li>

<li>Address book</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, native capabilities will continue to push the boundaries forward with features like <span>Near Field Communication</span> or maybe built-in credit card swipes.</p>

<p>For small teams on limited budgets, the mobile web app approach usually makes sense, especially when you expose an API so that third parties can create your Android/iPhone/Blackberry/etc apps.</p>

<p>Eventually, you may want to bring those capabilities in-house if it’s a critical part of your business but in general, it’s cheaper and faster to take this approach.</p>

<hr>
<div><a name="choosing_platforms_programming_languages_"></a></div>
<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">III. Set up infrastructure</span> &gt; <span>Choosing platforms</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="programming_languages">Programming languages</h1>

<p>Ruby or Python? Java? Is Ruby on Rails a language? Is Node.js?</p>

<p>For developers, these questions are pretty easy. For others, they’re very confusing. Here’s a quick breakdown of languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby: our server-side preference</li>

<li>Javascript: our client-side preference</li>

<li>Coffeescript: pleasant language on top of Javascript</li>
</ul>
<p>We use all three of those languages regularly. “Server-side” means code that is run on clusters of servers provided by your <a href="#application_hosting">application hosting company</a>. “Client-side” means code that is run in the web browsers of your users.</p>

<p>Some languages you might choose as an alternative to Ruby:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python: most similar to Ruby</li>

<li>PHP: widely used by freelancers</li>

<li>Java: widely used in enterprises</li>
</ul>
<p>Some languages you might use rarely for specific tasks, often performance-related:</p>

<ul>
<li>Erlang: great for highly-concurrent code</li>

<li>C: the programming lingua franca</li>
</ul>
<p>Some languages you might use if you’re writing native mobile apps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Objective-C: the language for iOS apps</li>

<li>Scala: pleasant language on top of Java, <span>can be used for Android development</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="languages_versus_frameworks">Languages versus frameworks</h2>

<p>Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and other libraries are <a href="#frameworks">frameworks</a> that require you know the underlying language such as Ruby or Javascript.</p>

<hr>
<div><a name="choosing_platforms_frameworks_"></a></div>
<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">III. Set up infrastructure</span> &gt; <span>Choosing platforms</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h1>

<p>A framework is a library that makes performing a particular task in a programming language easier. Just like the framework of a house, it’s there when you begin programming and is always there giving the program structure and support.</p>

<p>It can be difficult to switch from one framework to another. The more code that’s written specifically for Rails, the harder it will be to switch to Django. That would approach “total rewrite” territory. If an app is lightly using Prototype for client-side interaction, it is relatively easy to switch to jQuery.</p>

<p>Here are some of our favorite frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>

<li>jQuery</li>

<li>jQuery Mobile</li>

<li>Backbone.js</li>
</ul>

<span class="tier-one">III. Set up infrastructure</span> &gt; <span>Choosing platforms</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="databases">Databases</h1>

<p>If <a href="#strengths">unique data</a> is one of our most important advantages, choosing the right databases is also important.</p>

<p>For data that absolutely must be saved and stored correctly, we use <span>PostgreSQL</span> (we usually refer to it as “Postgres”).</p>

<p>It’s a 30 year old open source database that is highly respected, well supported by documentation and hosting providers, and easily used by any developer who knows the SQL standard.</p>

<h2 id="nosql">NoSQL</h2>

<p>In recent years, a movement called <span>NoSQL</span> has gained popularity. Translated to “not only SQL”, tremendous effort has been made to create different kinds of databases for different use cases.</p>

<p>They are often based off academic or industry research. <span>This is the best collection of NoSQL papers</span> we’ve seen. Great stuff from Amazon, Google, and others.</p>

<p>Our most frequently used NoSQL databases are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redis (data that is high-write, frequently changes, in moderate amounts)</li>

<li>MongoDB (data that is high-write, rarely changes, in large amounts)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="redis">Redis</h2>

<p><span>Redis</span> is reliable, open-source, and simple. It’s easy to predict how it will perform, and it can flexibly model different data sets.</p>

<p>We use Redis for:</p>

<ul>
<li>counters / downloads / hits / votes</li>

<li>rate limiting</li>

<li>timelines / activity feeds / inboxes</li>

<li>queues and background jobs</li>

<li>ad serving</li>

<li>friends / followers / social relationships</li>

<li>tags</li>

<li>leader boards</li>

<li>sessions</li>

<li>transient data like <span>CSRF tokens</span>
</li>

<li>A/B tests</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically use <span>Redis to Go</span> to host our production Redis databases.</p>

<h2 id="mongodb">MongoDB</h2>

<p><span>MongoDB</span>, which we usually refer to as “Mongo”, is scalable, open-source, fast, and has great options for querying.</p>

<p>We use Mongo for:</p>

<ul>
<li>location / geospatial data</li>

<li>data that is okay to lose portions of, like logging</li>

<li>error data in <span>Airbrake</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically use <span>MongoHQ</span> to host our production Mongo databases.</p>

<div class="breadcrumbs">
<span class="tier-one">III. Set up infrastructure</span> &gt; <span>Choosing platforms</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="software_licenses">Software licenses</h1>

<p>There are many open source software licenses. In contrast with a proprietary license, the source code of the program is made available for review, modification and redistribution.</p>

<p>The difference between open source licenses is what you can and can’t do with the source code.</p>

<p>Open source licenses can be divided in two categories: permissive and copyleft. Permissive examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) licenses</span></li>

<li><span>MIT license</span></li>

<li><span>Apache license</span></li>
</ul>
<p>A copyleft example is the <span>General Public License (GPL)</span>.</p>

<p>They all have the purpose of establishing the copyright holder for the software, granting users the right to copy, modify and redistribute it, protecting the copyright holder from any potential guarantees that the software may provide (software is provided as-is), and optionally imposing some restrictions.</p>

<p>Permissive licenses let you to modify a program, redistribute it, and even sell it. You can embed or link code with other programs without restriction or explicit permission by the copyright holder.</p>

<p>Copyleft licenses only allow you to link or distribute code with other code that has the same license. It also forces modifications to be released under the same license.</p>

<p>Combining anything with the GPL makes it GPL. This is what’s referred to as <strong>copyleft</strong>. It’s a play on the word copyright that enforces some restrictions on the opposite side of your traditional, proprietary and commercial licenses.</p>

<p>Non-copyleft licenses do not enforce derivative works to also be open source.</p>

<p>Some software is released under a dual license: both a permissive and copyleft license. This provides developers who use the dual licensed code to apply the license that better suits their needs.</p>

<p>Most of the software we use has a permissive license:</p>

<h1 id="laptop">Laptop</h1>

<p>We have a <span>laptop script</span> that once you’ve installed <span>GCC for Mac OS X</span> is a one-liner that sets up a basic development environment:</p>

<pre><code>bash &lt; &lt;(curl -s https://raw.github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/master/mac)</code></pre>

<p>There is also an Ubuntu version of the script but almost all of us run Mac OS X. If you have a Windows machine, we suggest you install Ubuntu on it or get an Apple laptop.</p>

<p>This sets up:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSH public keys (for authenticating with services like GitHub and Heroku)</li>

<li>Homebrew or apt-get (for managing operating system libraries)</li>

<li>Ack (for finding things in files)</li>

<li>Tmux (for saving project state and switching between projects)</li>

<li>Postgres (for storing relational data)</li>

<li>Redis (for storing key-value data)</li>

<li>ImageMagick (for cropping and resizing images)</li>

<li>RVM (for managing versions of the Ruby programming language)</li>

<li>Ruby 1.9.2 stable (for writing general-purpose code)</li>

<li>Bundler gem (for managing Ruby libraries)</li>

<p>For project communication, user story planning, emergent iterations, we recommend an app we wrote:</p>

<p><span>Trajectory</span> (free trial, $10/month).</p>

<p>We have also heavily used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basecamp</li>

<li>JIRA</li>

<li>Lighthouse</li>

<li>Pivotal Tracker</li>

<li>Unfuddle</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t feel it’s necessary to have a separate bug tracker. We believe it’s important to have a great discussion tool (like Basecamp) integrated into the same system as a great story planner (like Pivotal Tracker). Trajectory is the realization of our beliefs.</p>

<h1 id="version_control">Version control</h1>

<p>Always use source code control. It’s like a time machine. You can work in parallel universes of your source code, experimenting without fear of losing work. Roll back if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>There’s only one choice for version control today and that’s <span>git</span>.</p>

<p>Git is an open source source code control system written by Linus Torvalds. It’s fast and makes branching really easy.</p>

<p>It’s fast, incredibly useful, and becoming widely understood: we ran an event for 300 college students in 2011 who aspired to work at web startups and 80% of the crowd raised their hand when we asked if they knew git.</p>

<p>We recommend <span>GitHub</span> for hosting your git repositories.</p>

<p>It is free-$200/month.</p>

<p>Almost everyone at thoughtbot uses vim as their text editor. Despite backgrounds in Java, .NET, and other environments, we reject IDEs in favor of an old editor with great extensibility and programmibility.</p>

<p>vim is popular and well-supported in the Rails world. If you give it a try, definitely install <span>rails.vim</span>. If you’re using thoughtbot’s <span>dotfiles</span>, you’ll get it and some other goodies for free.</p>

<h1 id="continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</h1>

<p>After <a href="#test_driven_development">Test-Driven Development</a>, Continuous Integration (CI) is the most important Extreme Programming practice we employ.</p>

<p>Martin Fowler has an <span>extensive description</span> of the practice that we won’t repeat here. The basics are:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a test suite that each developer runs on their own machine.</li>

<li>When they commit their code to a shared <a href="#version_control">version control</a> repository, the tests are run again, “integrated” with code from other developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps ensure there’s nothing specific to the developer’s machine making the tests pass. The code in version control needs to run cleanly in production later so before the code is allowed to be deployed to production, it is run on a CI server or service.</p>

<h2 id="fail_notification">Fail notification</h2>

<p>When a build fails, we get alerts in Campfire and via email. Here’s an example of an open source project, <span>kumade</span> (which makes deploying to Heroku even nicer), failing:</p>
<span>
  </span>
<p>Click through to the build and we see:</p>
<span>
  </span>
<p>The backtrace gives us a hint of how to “fix the build.”</p>

<h2 id="pass_notification">Pass notification</h2>

<p>When we write the fix and commit to version control again, we’ll get a “passing build” notification:</p>
<span>
  </span>
<p>Click through to the build and we see:</p>
<span>
  </span>
<p>Green is good.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>A solid test suite is an absolute requirement for a web application in our opinion. However, one major problem with test suites is that they get slow as they get large.</p>

<p>CI can ease the pain by distributing the test runs in parallel. We’ve had 45 minute test suites cut down to 2 minutes using this technique.</p>

<h2 id="diy_or_hosted_service">DIY or hosted service?</h2>

<p>We’ve used CruiseControl, Integrity, Hudson (now called Jenkins), and other CI libraries that we manage ourselves. This resulted in many hours of expensive attention.</p>

<p>We now use <span>Travis CI</span> for our open source projects. Travis has rocketed to popularity in the community, is impeccably designed, and integrates smoothly with GitHub.</p>

<p>We’ve been beta testing <span>tddium</span>, a paid, hosted CI service that is highly parallel-ized and integrates smoothly with Heroku.</p>

<p>Someone will eventually create a great hosted CI service that we’ll feel good using for our private applications’ test suites. We’d pay a pretty penny for it given the expense we’ve seen of managing CI ourselves. Travis and tddium look like the best contenders right now.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to create a consumer brand, make something up.</p>

<p>Etsy, Zynga, <span>Airbrake</span>. Short and memorable. Somewhat easy to spell. You dominate searches. Those words meant nothing until they imbued them with their own brands’ meaning. Easier to get a domain name that isn’t crazy long + Twitter account, etc.</p>

<h2 id="domain_name_availability">Domain name availability</h2>

<p>Try <span>Domainr</span> to see what’s available.</p>

<h2 id="buying_maintaining_domain_names">Buying, maintaining domain names</h2>

<p>We recommend <span>DNSimple</span> to buy and maintain your domain name. If you already have a domain registered elsewhere, like GoDaddy, DNSimple provides a transfer service that makes it easy to switch.</p>

<p>We like for its simplicity. It also has templates we most often need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heroku</li>

<li>Google Apps</li>

<li>Tumblr</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ssl_certificates">SSL certificates</h2>

<p>DNSimple also provides SSL certificates. We recommend using them. We recommend buying a wildcard certificate (<code>*.domain.com</code>). It’s $100/year instead of $20/year but will make testing SSL on staging easier.</p>

<p>Follow <span>Ryan McGrearyâs steps</span> for adding a DNSimple SSL certificate to Heroku.</p>

<p>SSL and DNS are tightly coupled. If you’re doing any work with SSL, make sure you have access to make DNS changes, like adding a CNAME record. If you’re working with a client who has a department that handles DNS, schedule time during off-peak hours to pair program with the DNS person to make sure everything goes well. You can accidentally take down a site that is all SSL if this work isn’t done methodically.</p>

<span class="tier-one">Set up infrastructure</span> &gt; <span>Preparing the production environment</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="application_hosting">Application hosting</h1>

<p>Your web application needs to live somewhere, whether it be server hardware that’s exclusive to you, or shared with other sites.</p>

<p>We recommend <span>Heroku</span>. It’s a platform built on Amazon’s cloud infrastructure. It is simple to use when your app is just a toy and is built to scale up for high concurrency or high sustained load.</p>

<p>Like Rails, Heroku uses conventions to make decisions for you that are unnecessary for you to make; i.e. some things, like web servers and app servers, are solved problems. They act as your outsourced operations team. They charge a premium over bare-bones Amazon cloud but the amount of your attention they redirect back to your application instead of the production environment is worth it.</p>

<h2 id="the_cloud">The cloud</h2>

<p>The cloud promises lower operating costs, especially at the beginning when capacity can be lower. Forget about sunk costs of expensive servers.</p>

<p>We deploy all our applications to cloud services such as <span>Heroku</span> and <span>Blue Box Group</span>.</p>

<p>The cloud, and the services it enables will empower your business to start and operate in a manner that has never been possible before without significant upfront investment.</p>

<li>Performance. We recommend: <span>NewRelic RPM</span> (Free-$43/month).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fixing_performance_problems">Fixing performance problems</h2>

<p>This might be the best part of a developer’s job. There’s a clear, numeric problem. When you fix it, that number improves. You can say things like “I made this 175% better.”</p>

<p>There’s many established techniques for fixing performance problems. A number of them come “for free” with Rails + Heroku:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon server clusters</li>

<li><span>Varnish</span></li>

<li>
<span>nginx</span> with <span>fair proxy balancer</span> module</li>

<li>gzipping</li>

<li><span>Thin</span></li>

<li><span>Asset pipeline</span></li>

<li><span>SQL query caching</span></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of them require developer thought:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database indexing</li>

<li>Eager loading</li>

<li>HTTP caching</li>
</ul>
<p>The nginx web server can handle well over 50 million hits a day of static content. Thin app servers can handle about 2 million hits a day of static content. Those are big numbers and mean we can get a 25x improvement with page caching:</p>

<pre><code># config/environments/production.rb
config.action_controller.perform_caching = true</code></pre>

<p>Page caching is the heaviest handed technique we have, but if we can cache an entire page and push it into nginx or Varnish, that will be the fastest option.</p>

<p>As hard as everyone tries, some of the startups we work with fail.</p>

<p>Often the market doesn’t exist as expected. Sometimes it’s too expensive to create a user experience that will solve customers’ problems. Very rarely does the technology not work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the sidebar should be on the right, not the left.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="discussions">Discussions</h1>

<p>Instead of instruction, we want discussion. Saying something like “It’s hard to see against the background” or “it’s getting lost among in the other things on the bottom of the page” are better ways to communicate what you want.</p>

<p>We can’t talk about solutions until we identify the underlying problems. As tempting as it is to jump a step ahead and try to think of a solution, we regularly find that there’s an advantage to posing things as problems instead.</p>

<h2 id="written">Written</h2>

<p>It’s valuable for project communication to be written down in a central repository such as <span>Trajectory</span>.</p>

<p>When things are only said on the phone or in person, information gets lost, forgotten, or misinterpreted. The problems expand when someone joins or leaves the project.</p>

<h2 id="saying_no">Saying no</h2>

<p>We’ve been called “aggressive” with our approach cutting features, budgets, and schedules. We say “no” a lot.</p>

<p>It’s hard to say “no.” “No” is usually not well-received. There’s a reason someone requested the feature, and “yes” is backed up by his friends “go get ‘em” and “we can do it.”</p>

<p>We have to battle sometimes in the face of “yes”. We do so armed with knowledge of <span>the history of software success and failure</span>: in 2004, only 34% of software projects were considered successes.</p>

<p>The good news is that was 100% better than the stats in 1994. “The primary reason is the projects have gotten a lot smaller.”</p>

<p>Few software projects fail because they aren’t complicated enough.</p>

<p>Saying “no” means keeping the software we’re building as simple as possible. Every line of code we write is an asset and a liability.</p>

<p>Simple software, once launched, is better suited to meeting the demands of customers. Complex software, if it ever even launches, is not as able to respond to customer demands quickly.</p>

<h1 id="pair_programming">Pair programming</h1>

<p>Code that is written by two people who sit next to each at the same computer is pair-programmed code. That code is considered high quality and should result in cost savings due to less maintenance.</p>

<p>In the long run, this style of development saves money because fewer bugs are written and therefore do not need to be fixed later.</p>

<p>An indication that pairing is beneficial and should be done more often is the following example:</p>

<p>When you are writing an important piece of code, don’t you want another person to look it over before it goes into production?</p>

<p>Here’s the flow. Read <span>Josh Susserâs post</span> for the git commands.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start a user story.</li>

<li>Code the feature.</li>

<li>Push the feature to a branch.</li>

<li>A GitHub hook starts a CI build.</li>

<li>A <span>GitHub Campfire hook</span> posts your work to Campfire.</li>

<li>Click the link that’s in Campfire.</li>

<li><strong>Click the GitHub “Pull Request” button.</strong></li>

<li><strong>It selects all commits in your branch that are not in master.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Create the pull request.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Ask your team in Campfire for a review of the pull request.</strong></li>

<li><strong>The team comments in-line, right on the code.</strong></li>

<li>Make the suggested changes.</li>

<li>Merge into master.</li>

<li>Push to master.</li>

<li>CI runs again.</li>

<li>Deploy to staging.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many teams use this “feature branch” pattern. The “code review” part is the GitHub pull request to team comments.</p>

<p>Here’s what a pull request looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>The whole team learns about new code as it is written.</li>

<h2 id="acceptance_tests">Acceptance Tests</h2>

<p>Acceptance tests are created from user stories. They look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Given I am signed in as an admin
When I delete a comment with a confirmation dialog
Then the comment is deleted</code></pre>

<p>This is executable code that is run against the application. When executed for the first time, the test will fail. The developer can then code until the test passes.</p>

<p>When the test passes, the developer commits the code into version control with a message such as:</p>

<pre><code>Comments can be moderated by admins</code></pre>

<p>The code is then run on the <span>Continuous Integration</span> server to make sure the acceptance test still passes in an environment that matches the production environment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the code is pushed to the staging environment and the developer and customer representative smoke test it in the browser.</p>

<p>When the acceptance test is green for the CI server and the developer and customer representative are satisfied that the user story is complete on staging, the feature can be deployed to production at will. This can result in features being pushed to production very frequently, and therefore more value is being delivered to customers sooner.</p>

<p>We like to enjoy our weekends. They give our bodies a rest and let our unconscious minds help us solved problems we struggled with the previous week.</p>

<p>On Mondays, we hold weekly retrospectives. Everyone on the team gets together and:</p>

<ul>
<li>Says how they’re feeling</li>

<h2 id="status_updates">Status updates</h2>

<p>We recently saw one of our clients do something we thought was also effective. They sent out a simple email to their stakeholders (development team, investors, etc.), held themselves accountable for last week’s work, and made promises for the upcoming week.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Team,</p>

<p>Please take time to sign up for our beta and please help to promote our site by sending the link to your friends and colleagues: http://example.com.</p>

<p>This is an exciting time for us, as we’re getting close to having an alpha. Our goal was to get to market within two months of beginning development. It looks like we’re going to be well under two months. I believe this rapid development means that investors and shareholders are getting good value.</p>

<p>ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR THE WEEK ENDING xx/xx/xx:</p>

<ul>
<li>Naming. We finally were able to purchase the final domain name and trademark. We own the previous mark and registered the mark under new categories.</li>

<li>Fundraising. New investors onboard.</li>

<li>Basic site workflow of searching records - you can now do this on the site.</li>

<li>Merchant Account. Merchant account in place.</li>

<li>Customer service. Support App is in place</li>
</ul>
<p>GOALS FOR THE WEEK BEGINNING xx/xx/xx</p>

<ul>
<li>Start working on uploading products through system. Start to seed database.</li>

<li>Get to alpha. Test both upload and download of products through the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions (xxx.xxx.xxxx). Thanks so much for your hard work this week.</p>

<p>If you’d like to unsubscribe to our weekly updates, please let me know.</p>

<ul>
<li>We can produce good design in a relatively short timespan, but producing design that meets our standards takes time.</li>

<li>Great design requires research, experimentation, and revisions.</li>

<li>
<span>Here are examples</span> of design that we feel are great. All of these went through many changes and look entirely different then when they were originally conceived.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="functionality_trumps_style">Functionality trumps style</h2>

<p>Since all visual design prompts subjective reactions that can be strong, it can be difficult to come to a consensus. Our sites are built to be used, not merely to be looked at, so the style should not take precedence over the functionality. We should advocate for the needs of the user, not the whims of the client. Asking certain questions can help to highlight why something should be done one way as opposed to another:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it add value to the site?</li>

<li>Does it communicate something important to the user?</li>

<li>Does it make the site easier to use?</li>

<li>Does it have a function within the site, or is decoration?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what_doesnt_work">What doesn’t work</h2>

<ul>
<li>The client uses outside designers such as 99designs to influence or supplement the design. This is often done with the goal of saving money.</li>

<li>thoughtbot doesn’t clarify the brand vision or target audience.</li>

<li>More than one or two people on the client side are influencing the design.</li>

<li>The client is making requests for color, layout, or other design element instead of accepting or rejecting the designs on the basis of the brand vision or target audience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why_it_doesnt_work">Why it doesn’t work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Design by committee results in a <span>design that is the lowest common denominator</span>.</li>

<li>Design by committee results in a lack of cohesiveness in the design.</li>

<li>It’s never totally clear exactly how much or which parts of the outside design to integrate.</li>

<li>It’s slow.</li>

<li>It pulls the rug out from underneath the designer before he or she gets started.</li>

<li>The focus is on things that don’t matter as much.</li>

<h1 id="the_design_process">The design process</h1>

<p>When building software for the web, there are many different actionable states of a specific design element that get built during the HTML/CSS wireframing phase (e.g. add, edit, update).</p>

<p>These states typically do not make it into the wireframes because it would be too time-consuming. Usually, with a clear understanding of the designers vision via a sketch or discussion, these states are better left for developers to create first.</p>

<p>When the initial HTML markup and functionality is in place, a designer will proceed to take over to refine the UX and visual design. HTML/CSS wireframes are built using <span>High Voltage</span> and are located in the app/views/pages directory.</p>

<p>It is crucial to keep the design of the application ahead of the development. Focus should be placed on wireframing usability, UX, flows, and personas. These larger chunks require wireframes to be done first to be successful with our outside-in process.</p>

<p>We find it important to keep the design and development cycle adequately tight. We do not wireframe one month out because:</p>

<ul>
<li>we often decide to cut features during the week prior, or week of, while building the application</li>

<li>as we approach certain areas of the application while designing and developing, the requirements and features change</li>
</ul>
<p>The change in requirements is part of the iterative process and feedback loop from the client, the thoughtbot team, and from user-testing. It would be wasteful to spend time wireframing features that never get built.</p>

<h1 id="user_experience_ux">User experience (UX)</h1>

<p>If there’s a more desired person by startup founders than a good Rails developer, it’s a good UX designer. However, like Bigfoot, no one can really agree on what that person looks like.</p>

<p>Solid arguments can be made that <a href="#strengths">user experience is the most important thing</a> a web or mobile app should focus on:</p>

<ul>
<li>a great product is one a customer emotionally engages with</li>

<li>user experience is the only real relationship a customer has with your company</li>

<li>a product is necessary but not sufficient</li>

<li>people rationalize their purchases but typically make them emotionally and certainly stay connected to the product emotionally, not rationally</li>

<li>people are willing to pay more for an emotionally positive experience</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>User experience is what your user feels, sees, hears, and touches.</p>

<h2 id="who_does_it">Who does it?</h2>

<p>We like to say Everybody Codes, which is shorthand for saying on small web teams, everyone is a maker. We could just as easily say “Everybody Sells” or “Everybody Designs Experiences” but we think the raw act of hands typing code is a better visual to focus on.</p>

<p>In our opinion, this is the CEO’s role. The person in charge is ultimately responsible for delivering a positive user experience. He or she then delegates certain tasks.</p>

<p>We don’t think you should hire a “UX designer.” Definitely <a href="#roles">hire a designer</a>, but their role includes user experience, visual design, usability testing, writing HTML and CSS, etc.</p>

<h1 id="visual_design">Visual design</h1>

<p>Most designers we know have had some formal training in this area, but we recommend other team members, especially developers who are on the front lines of editing HTML and CSS, also <span>learn the fundamentals of visual design</span>.</p>

<p>Those fundamentals include, among others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alignment (often achieved with grids)</li>

<li>Emphasis (often achieved with size, position, color)</li>

<li>Consistency (buttons, links, headers typically look alike)</li>

<li>Whitespace (elegant, timeless, gives eye a rest)</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful visual designs typically don’t draw attention to themselves. The content will be front-and-center. The workflows through the site will be obvious. Resist the temptation to aim for a design that is “memorable” or a design that “pops.”</p>

<p>Successful designs are usable. Consider Google’s new visual design.</p>
<span>
  </span>
<p>Everything’s on a grid. The “Search Mail” and “Compose Mail” buttons are emphasized over other calls to action with color. The unread messages are emphasized over other messages with bolding.</p>

<p>We’re testing the software, not you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="usability_testing">Usability testing</h1>

<p>Usability is how easy an application is for the user to use.</p>

<p>If it is intended for power users, it should be easy to remember what to do and designed for efficiency. If it’s a landing page trying to convert as many visitors into customers, it should be easy for the visitor to learn what the product is and easy for them to sign up and easy for them to try the product, etc.</p>

<h2 id="how_to_run_usability_tests">How to run usability tests</h2>

<p><span>Steve Krugâs works</span> are the canonical resources for usability testing. Here’s his major points and how we’ve implemented them.</p>

<p>“A morning a month, that’s all we ask.” We set up usability testing every other Thursday at our office. Any project can sign up.</p>

<p>“Start earlier than you’d think.” We often test sketches. The earlier the stage, the more we’re testing the problem/solution fit. The later the stage, the more we’re testing actual usability.</p>

<p>“Recruit loosely and grade on a curve.” Our office manager puts a posting on Craigslist, schedules them to come into our office, and pays them $30 for their time after the test.</p>

<p>“Make it a spectator sport.” We have one person sitting next to the test subject, guiding them through the test. We use <span>Silverback</span> to record the screen and their face and the rest of the team watches the test from another room and makes comments in real-time without disturbing the test.</p>

<p>“Focus ruthlessly on a small number of the most important problems.” After the session, we identify the top handful of problems and fix them before the next round of usability tests.</p>

<p>“When fixing problems, do the least you can do.” If there’s a problem revealed with the navigation, there’s a temptation to totally re-do it. We try to resist that urge and come up with less drastic changes.</p>

<p>Finally, and we love this line, when the participant arrives and we introduce ourselves and explain the process, always remind them “we’re testing the software, not you.” It’s not “user testing”, it’s “usability testing.” Ask them to say out loud what they’re thinking as they’re using the software, which can feel unnatural but is important.</p>

<h2 id="craigslist_post">Craigslist post</h2>

<p>We have a simple template for finding people on Craigslist.</p>

<pre><code>Title: Get paid to help us test our websites

We're looking for people to use our websites and give us feedback.

We'll sit you down at a computer and have you perform a handful of tasks, giving us feedback as you do so. You don't need to be an expert at using the computer or the internet; in fact, we'd prefer people who consider themselves average users.

We'll need about 30 minutes of your time and will pay you $30. The sessions will take place this XX and XX, XXX XX and XX between Xpm and Xpm.

Our office is right next to Boston Common and is easily accessible from the Green, Red and Orange lines. You can find out more about our company by visiting our website: http://thoughtbot.com

</blockquote>

<h1 id="api">API</h1>

<p>An Application Programming Interface (API) is a way for developers to access your startup’s data. Well-known examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Twitter</span></li>

<li><span>Foursquare</span></li>

<li><span>Google Maps</span></li>

<li><span>Amazon Web Services</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a fad. We encourage our clients to both leverage existing APIs and to build a consumable API for their business. It can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>another revenue stream</li>

<li>a way to increase traffic and traction</li>

<li>unveil ways to pivot the business</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consuming_an_api_in_ruby">Consuming an API in Ruby</h2>

<p>Most APIs today are HTTP APIs and use the <span>JSON</span> data format.</p>

<p>A solid way to consume an HTTP JSON API with Ruby is with the <span>rest-client</span> gem and (if you’re using Ruby 1.9, which you should be at this point) the <span>JSON library</span> from Ruby’s Standard Library.</p>

<pre><code>require 'rest_client'
require 'json'

class API
  def self.get(path, options = {})
    params   = options.merge(credentials).to_query
    response = RestClient.get("#{root}#{path}?#{params}")
    JSON.parse(response)
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can do stuff like:</p>

<pre><code>class Instagram &lt; API
  def self.root
    "https://api.instagram.com/v1"
  end

  def self.credentials
    { :client_id =&gt; INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID }
  end

  def self.find(lat, lng)
    json = get "/media/search", :lat =&gt; lat, :lng =&gt; lng
    json['data'].map {|data|  data['images']['standard_resolution'] }.
                 map {|image| image['url'] }
  end

<p>You may need an email sending service for your application to send automated email to your users, known as <span>transactional email</span>. We recommend: <span>SendGrid</span>. (Free-$400/month)</p>

<p>Examples of transactional email are:</p>

<h1 id="social_sharing">Social sharing</h1>

<p>A goal like “share our content as broadly as possible” puts our company’s needs before those of users. It’s low friction (one click) and will get our content into a massive network. Sounds good, but how does a user clicking the Facebook <span>Like button</span> benefit them?</p>

<p>Let’s think in user stories instead.</p>

<pre><code>As a user with a Facebook account,
I want to share a video of Rajon Rondo with a few of my Boston Celtics-loving friends.</code></pre>

<p>It’s rare that we’ll have content that will be broadly applicable to a user’s entire social network. In this use case, I have a few Facebook friends in mind with whom I want to share the content. This is a perfect scenario for the Facebook <span>Send button</span>.</p>

<p>The Send button can track <span>basic analytics and demographics</span>.</p>

<p>Let’s try another.</p>

<pre><code>As a user without a Facebook account,
I want to share a video of Rajon Rondo with a few of my Boston Celtics-loving friends.</code></pre>

<p>Facebook’s huge but not everyone has an account or enjoys using the service. Many of us prefer email or other means. In that case, all we need is a URL, preferably shortened, that users can copy and paste wherever they please. Youtube has been doing this for years:</p>
<img src="https://thoughtbot-handbook.s3.amazonaws.com/youtube-sharing.png" alt="Youtube sharing"><p>This feature has the added benefit of being very easy to implement.</p>

<h1 id="game_mechanics">Game mechanics</h1>

<p>First, we want to be careful of cargo-cult game mechanics. Features like the following warrant extra scrutiny:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leaderboards</li>

<li>Activity feeds</li>

<li>Points</li>

<li>Badges</li>
</ul>
<p>If the feature does pass scrutiny, consider using <span>Redis</span> to implement them. For example, look at the <span>leaderboard gem</span> by Agora Games.</p>

<p>Redis is a good fit for these scenarios because it’s great at storing moderate amounts of fast-changing data.</p>

<p>For activity feeds, we like the <span>timeline_fu</span> library. It’s ActiveRecord-based and beautifully simple.</p>

<h2 id="significant_achievements">Significant achievements</h2>

<p>Dennis Crowley has talked about his desire for Foursquare’s badges to <span>reflect truly significant achievements</span>. Not a bad rule of thumb.</p>

<p>A successful example of game mechanics is in <span>UserVoiceâs Helpdesk product</span>:</p>
<img src="https://thoughtbot-handbook.s3.amazonaws.com/user-voice-scores.png" alt="UserVoice Helpdesk"><p>This is a personal scoreboard telling the user how well they’re handling customer support. It animates and changes color each time the user responds to customer support requests, providing little hits of encouragement.</p>

<p>It totally changes the attitude of customer support from a chore to something a little fun.</p>

<h2 id="points">Points</h2>

<p>School is a game. Class rank is a leaderboard. A professor in Indiana decided the A-F grading system sucked so he re-designed it so that you start the class with 0 points, and build points for attendance, assignments turned in on time, etc. Your A-F grade at the end of the semester is calculated based on your semester’s worth of points.</p>

<h2 id="behavior_change">Behavior change</h2>

<p>The reason our clients are interested in game mechanics is because they have been wildly successful, particularly by Zynga. They drive behavior change, and we want to affect the behavior of our users, right?</p>

<p>Influencing behavior change in others brings with it significant moral implications. Are we comfortable using psychology and design techniques to make people behave in ways that their conscious brain might not even be aware of?</p>

<h1 id="location_awareness">Location awareness</h1>

<p>At this point in internet history, we can usually operate on the assumption that we can get the user’s location.</p>

<p>Here’s how easy it is to use the HTML5 geolocation API:</p>

<pre><code>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
  console.log(position.coords.latitude + " " +
              position.coords.longitude);
})</code></pre>

<p>Paste that into your browser’s Javascript console and you should see your current latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>On an iPhone, users get a message like:</p>
<img src="https://thoughtbot-handbook.s3.amazonaws.com/would-like-to-use-your-current-location.PNG" alt="Would like to use your current location" width="350px"><p>Here’s a slightly more complex example that displays a static map and uses <span>geo.js</span> for better cross-browser compatibility:</p>

<pre><code>function success(position) {
  var latitude  = position.coords.latitude;
  var longitude = position.coords.longitude;
  var mapUrl    = "http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=" +
    latitude + "," + longitude +
    "&amp;zoom=14&amp;size=320x160&amp;sensor=false"
  $('#map').attr('src', mapUrl).show();
}
function failure(failureMessage) {
  $('#geolocation-failure').show();
}
if (geo_position_js.init()) {
  geo_position_js.getCurrentPosition(
    success, failure,
    { enableHighAccuracy : true }
  );
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="gps">GPS</h2>

<p>See that <code>enableHighAccuracy</code> option in the last example?</p>

<h2 id="geocoding">Geocoding</h2>

<p>We recommend the <span>geocoder gem</span> for:</p>

<ul>
<li>geocoding (lat/lng by street or IP address)</li>

<li>reverse geocoding (street address by lat/lng)</li>

<li>distance queries</li>
</ul>
<p>It works great with ActiveRecord and <span>Mongoid</span>:</p>

<pre><code>class Location
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Geocoder::Model::Mongoid

  field :coordinates, :type =&gt; Array
  field :address, :default =&gt; ""

  geocoded_by :address

  after_validation :geocode

  def lat
    to_coordinates.first
  end

  def lng
    to_coordinates.last
  end

  def nearby_images
    Instagram.media_search(lat, lng)
  end
end</code></pre>

<h2 id="mongodb_geospatial_indexing">MongoDB geospatial indexing</h2>

<p>MongoDB has great <span>geospatial indexing</span> that makes it a good fit for geocoded objects. We recommend using it specifically for that need.</p>

<p>You can have a dominantly Postgres-backed application that uses Mongo only for location use cases. Mongoid will sit nicely side-by-side with ActiveRecord.</p>

<p>Zendesk offers a pretty <span>slick phone support</span> product. If we’re trying to be really good about customer support, we ought to ask, “what method do customers really want to use to interact with us?” In general, <span>the answer is overwhelmingly the old telephone</span>.</p>

<p>Earlier, we defined actionable metrics using Dave McClure’s <a href="#aarrr">AARRR</a> framework. We said we’d focus on them in this order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Activation, Retention (happiness)</li>

<li>Revenue (sustainability)</li>

<li>Acquisition, Referral (virality)</li>
</ol>
<p>To know how good our activation numbers are, we track them as events in <span>KISSMetrics</span> and run <a href="#a_b_testing">A/B tests</a> to see which changes improve our conversion percentages.</p>

<p>To know how good our retention numbers are, we track <a href="#cohorts">cohorts</a> in KISSMetrics and use <a href="#feature_flags">feature flags</a> to roll out new functionality to subsets of users to see which changes improve our retention coefficient.</p>

</blockquote>

<h1 id="ab_testing">A/B testing</h1>

<p>Once your app is well-instrumented with measurements, you get a clearer picture of the AARRR funnel and see where the biggest problems are. Seeing this, it might be clear how to fix the issue. It might help <a href="#usability_testing">to put the flow in front of someone else</a>.</p>

<p>But some problems are rooted deeper in users’s minds. Someone can tell you when they’re confused by a page with too many things going on or when they’re frustrated by too many upsells during the checkout process. They probably can’t honestly tell you whether one set of copy or another is more likely to make them feel an affinity with your landing page, pull out their wallet, and plunk down cash.</p>

<p>So you don’t tell them they’re in an experiment, and you let their actions do the talking instead.</p>

<p>The <span>KISSmetrics Marketing Blog</span> has excellent A/B testing content. For example, read their article on <span>testing landing pages</span>.</p>

<p>From our experience, the most important thing about improving conversion on a landing page is eliminating steps the user can take before signing up for your free trial or immediately using the service.</p>

<p>We want the user to feel the service is useful as quickly as possible. Generate a feeling of “yes, this is for me!” within seconds, and validate their first impression within minutes.</p>

<p>If you need people to sign up before doing anything interesting with your app, we recommend streamlining the sign up form to one (or maybe two) fields:</p>

<ol>
<li>email</li>

<li>(maybe) password</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ab_testing_with_kissmetrics">A/B testing with KISSMetrics</h2>

<h1 id="cohorts">Cohorts</h1>

<p>A cohort is a group of users that joined during a particular time period. We care about tracking cohorts because it more accurately tells us whether users love the app than other metrics. You can set up cohort reports with <span>KISSMetrics</span>.</p>

<p><span>Andrew Chen</span> has a good example:</p>

<pre><code>Unique actions by Week 1 cohort:

week 1: 100,000
week 2: 50,000
week 3: 25,000

Unique actions by Week 2 cohort:

week 2: 125,000
week 3: 50,000</code></pre>

<p>Between weeks 1 and 2, there’s a:</p>

<ul>
<li>25% increase in new users (100k to 125k)</li>

<li>40% decrease in retention (50k/100k versus 50k/125k)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the site sucks despite good aggregate stats:</p>

<pre><code>week 1 uniques: 100,000
week 2 uniques: 175,000</code></pre>

<h2 id="retention_coefficient">Retention coefficient</h2>

<p>More from Andrew Chen: <span>download his retention model spreadsheet</span> and look at the third page.</p>

<p>When you have as high as 80% retention, your app will die unless you have crazy, Groupon- or Match.com-like paid marketing going into the top of your funnel. The graph will look like a “shark fin.”</p>

<p>It takes 95%-100% retention to have a winner.</p>

<h2 id="email_your_cohorts">Email your cohorts</h2>

<p>Ash Maurya has a couple of smart ideas regarding cohorts:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span>email users who fail to convert</span> and ask them what’s wrong.</li>

<li>
<span>email users who are paying AND using the product</span> to give them the Sean Ellis Test</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the_sean_ellis_test">The Sean Ellis Test</h2>

<p>How would you feel if you could no longer use this service?</p>

<ul>
<li>Very disappointed</li>

<li>Somewhat disappointed</li>

<li>Not disappointed</li>

<li>N/A - I no longer use it</li>
</ul>
<p>If 40% or greater of responses say “very disappointed”, the business has a good chance to scale.</p>

<p>Ash also says in <span>Running Lean</span> that 40% retention month-over-month is equivalent to the 40% “very disappointed” number. If you hit that, you’ve hit product-market fit.</p>

<h1 id="feature_flags">Feature flags</h1>

<p>Software is soft. It’s always changing. Hopefully, we’re always learning from our changes.</p>

<p>A cool way to manage changes is via feature flags. Using a tool like <span>Rollout</span>, we can “flag” certain features as only ready for parts of our user base; i.e. just the development team, or just the founder’s friends, or 10% of all users, etc.</p>

<p>That way, we can see how users respond to the feature without rolling it out to everyone. We can pair this technique with <a href="#a_b_testing">A/B testing</a> to compare how different features are responded to by different parts of the population.</p>

<h2 id="example_netflix">Example: Netflix</h2>

<p>Netflix’ <span>Q2 2006 quarterly earnings report</span> and <span>Q2 2006 quarterly earnings call</span> with Reed Hastings and Barry McCarthy tells us a bunch of data we can use for a large-scale SaaS example.</p>

<p>The newer <span>quarterly earnings reports</span> are interesting, too, but the 2006 version explicitly details churn and Customer (they call it Subscriber) Acquisition Cost. The raw data:</p>

<pre><code>Revenue   $239,400,000.00
Costs     $227,177,550.00
Customers 5,169,000
Churn     4.30%</code></pre>

<p>And the calculations:</p>

<pre><code>CAC       $43.95
ARPU      $46.31
LTV       $1,077.08</code></pre>

<p>We can see that Netflix makes more Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) than they spend in acquiring each user (customer) each quarter, the best formula for profitability. Not only that, but at at a quarterly churn of 4%, each user is expected to be a customer for 5 years and bring in over $1,000 revenue.</p>

<p>However, Netflix was already very established by 2006. For earlier stage SaaS businesses, they have to deal with a <span>SaaS cash flow trough</span>, so comparing CAC to LTV is an earlier indicator that the business will be profitable.</p>

<h2 id="our_story">Our story</h2>

<p>In addition to consulting and workshops, we built SaaS apps like <span>Airbrake</span> and <span>Trajectory</span>.</p>

<p>There are some common themes among these apps:</p>

<ul>
<li>They were all solving our own problems.</li>

<li>We were the first customers.</li>

<li>They are intended for designers and developers like ourselves.</li>

<li>They are all hosted web services.</li>

<li>They are all <span>multi-tenant</span> applications.</li>

<li>They are all subscription-style services (monthly billing).</li>
</ul>
<p>The last few loosely define SaaS (software as a service) products.</p>

<p>We still have a lot to learn about running these SaaS products well but we’re fans of the model. We provide a free trial for each service and try to provide something for which users will want to pay a nominal monthly subscription.</p>

<h2 id="three_revenue_models">Three revenue models</h2>

<p><span>Lee Hower</span> and <span>Rob Go</span> have written that there are <span>only three revenue models on the internet</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li>media models (primarily ads)</li>

<li>transaction models (primarily e-commerce, also lead generation)</li>

<li>subscription models (primarily user-paid)</li>
</ul>
<p>This SaaS section refers to the third model.</p>

<h2 id="freemium">Freemium</h2>

<p>Freeium is not a business model. By definition, free is not revenue. Freemium is a marketing tactic.</p>

<p>Our newest products are not freemium. They are free trial. We moved in that direction because free-forever options can have negative market position and added overhead problems.</p>

<h1 id="customer_acquisition_cost">Customer Acquisition Cost</h1>

<pre><code>CAC = costs / customers</code></pre>

<p>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is calculated by adding all costs (employee compensation, hosting, marketing) over a period of time and dividing it by number of customers acquired during that time.</p>

<p>Example when our period of time is a month:</p>

<pre><code>1000 customers (not free trial users)
$4,500 payroll + benefits</code></pre>

<p>The CAC is $4.50:</p>

<pre><code>CAC = $4,500 / 1000</code></pre>

<p>Life Time Value is calculated by multiplying Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by the average length of the company’s relationship with a customer. You figure out the length by dividing 1 by the <span>churn rate</span> for the period.</p>

<p>Example when our period of time is a month:</p>

<pre><code>1000 customers (not free trial users)
$25,000 revenue</code></pre>

<p>This means the ARPU is $25.</p>

<pre><code>20% churn rate</code></pre>

<p>This means the average length of the relationship is 5 months. (5 * 20% is 100% turnover)</p>

<pre><code>LTV = $25 * (1 / 0.2)</code></pre>

<p>The LTV is $125.</p>

<h1 id="cost">Cost</h1>

<p>In New York City, you can buy a condo for $500k, and you can buy one for $20 million. They both include heat and hot water, and they both put a roof over your head. Pricing web applications isn’t that much different. The cheap option will save you money, but you’ll uncover a leaky roof that needs to be replaced sooner than later. On the high end, you’ll find that the $3000 espresso machine that was custom built to fit into your marble kitchen probably doesn’t make coffee that much better than a $30 pot would have.</p>

<h2 id="guessing_games">Guessing games</h2>

<p>The tradition in client services is to take a vaguely worded spec document and submit an exact timeframe and bid for certain (vaguely worded) deliverables. If you turn out to somehow be exactly right, everyone’s happy. If you turn out to have gone over on time and can’t deliver, the client sues you. If you turn out to have guessed under on time, you walk away with a massive profit and the client probably got screwed. Isn’t there a better way?</p>

<p>We don’t do fixed-bid fixed-feature-set proposals. This contract style sets the vendor and client working against each other instead of with each other, right from day one. Instead of <em>discussing</em> how a feature should be built, or what assumptions were wrong, you spend time <em>negotiating</em> about what was meant in a document written a long time ago. But it’s worse than negotiating – it’s retroactively discussing something that no one will remember the same way anyway.</p>

<h2 id="how_we_do_pricing">How we do pricing</h2>

<p>We price our projects with a resources per week model. For a given price, you are getting the equivalent of one week’s worth of effort (approximately a 40 hour work week) from one of our employees. We use the same rate for designers, developers, project managers, whatever. The iteration will dictate which skills and people are actually needed in a given week, and the resource level (1 person, 2 people, 3 people, …) will determine the cost, and how much gets done.</p>

<p>We don’t track time, and you won’t receive an itemized invoice showing individual pieces of work that were done. You will have constant insight into what’s happening via access to a story tracking tool and by constantly communicating with our project team. Typically, a project that’s starting from scratch will have 2 or 3 people worth of time working on it from the start.</p>

<h2 id="typical_costs">Typical Costs</h2>

<p>Coming up with an “average” project isn’t really representative of anything that’s actually happened, but these are guidelines to use for what a normal project looks like:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Size</th>
<th>Budget</th>
<th>Timeline</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Small</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">$50k - $100k</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">6-10 weeks of development</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">$100k - $250k</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">4-6 months of development</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Large</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">$500k - $1m+</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">12+ months of development</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the size here is not necessarily indicative of the raw complexity of the finished product. Sometimes to get to a very simple application you have to build it a few times before you finally get there.</p>

<p>On multiple occasions we’ve started with a project which had a budget under $50k for their “v1” product, and followed that up with a round of funding or actual revenue to continue development, which then put it in line with the “Small” range above.</p>

<h2 id="time_based_versus_milestone_based">Time based versus milestone based</h2>

<p>We sometimes have clients who don’t understand why we don’t do milestone based or “fixed bid” pricing for consulting engagements. We explain that it is no different than hiring an employee. Same thing, except we’re easier to fire.</p>

<h2 id="typical_engagement">Typical Engagement</h2>

<p>These things have all happened successfully:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-year contracts with existing businesses, supplementing their internal development teams.</li>

<li>3-6 month contracts where we explicitly replace ourselves with an internal team at the end.</li>

<li>Multi year engagement where we work 2 months on, 4 off, 1 on, 6 off – by jointly coordinating time and budget with clients.</li>

<h1 id="fundraising">Fundraising</h1>

<p>A decent first question is a reality check and a check on what the founding team really wants: is this a lifestyle or venture-scale business?</p>

<ul>
<li>Lifestyle: founders do not intend to sell. They intend to extract profits from the business in perpetuity. Typically less than $10 million annual revenue.</li>

<li>Venture-scale: more than $10 million in annual revenue with potential for more than $100 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with either model. 37signals argues that founders will be happier with the lifestyle business model. thoughtbot falls into this category. Our clients fall into both.</p>

<p>Let us know which one you are so we can help achieve your goals.</p>

<h2 id="bank_loan">Bank loan</h2>

<p>Businesses historically did, and still do, this. The differences between a bank loan and angel investment are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A bank loan is non-dilutive. Meaning, the founders keep 100% equity.</li>

<li>Banks want their money back, with interest. If your company fails, you still need to pay back the money. An angel investor wants to make a profit but knows that there’s a good chance they’ll never see their money again.</li>

<li>Consumer internet or mobile startup: 100,000 users with 30-50% month-over-month growth.</li>

<li>SaaS startup: LTV is 3x-5x greater than CAC, customer acquisition is repeatable and scalable, 10-30% month-over-month growth.</li>

<h1 id="accounting_and_bookkeeping">Accounting and bookkeeping</h1>

<p>Super-important but not your core competency. That’s the perfect situation for outsourcing.</p>

<p>We use and recommend <span>AccountingDepartment.com</span> for your accounting and bookkeeping needs. They are a “virtual accounting department”, which means they have a network of CPAs who work from home. You interact with them mostly through email. It’s very efficient.</p>

<p>Our CPA is excellent and provides <span>these sorts of services</span> for us:</p>

<ul>
<li>making sure payroll happens regularly and correctly</li>

<li>gathering our accounts payable and making sure we pay partners promptly</li>

<li>preparing monthly P&amp;Ls broken down by product</li>

<li>tax preparation</li>

<li>making sure cashflow, checking account, savings account are in order</li>
</ul>
<p>All our <a href="#expenses">receipts</a> go to them automatically.</p>

<h1 id="expenses">Expenses</h1>

<p>We buy things. The IRS appreciates it when we track those purchases. So do we, in order to know whether we’re profitable.</p>

<h2 id="receipts">Receipts</h2>

<p>We use <span>Shoeboxed</span> to send all receipts (meals, travel, books, computers) to our <a href="#accounting_and_bookkeeping">accountant</a>.</p>

<p>There’s also a <span>handy iPhone app</span> that makes taking a photo of the receipt and emailing it very easy.</p>

<h2 id="corporate_card">Corporate card</h2>

<p>Every full-time employee gets an <span>American Express corporate card</span> for business expenses. This helps minimize the reimbursement process.</p>

<span class="tier-one">V. Make money</span> &gt; <span>Handling your business</span> &gt;</div>
<h1 id="contracts">Contracts</h1>

<p>We have three main legal documents that we sign with clients:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <span>mutual NDA</span>.</li>

<li>A consulting proposal and contract.</li>

<li>A recruiting agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main one is the consulting proposal and contract.</p>

<p>It has a one page summary of the application, a high-level schedule of expected iterations and their themes (“Week 1: wireframes, user stories, hosting setup, user registration”, etc.), our weekly rate, and the <span>Net 15</span> terms.</p>

<p>It also has four pages of legalese, then one page for the signatures.</p>

<p>The recruiting agreement is used much less frequently. We don’t consider ourselves recruiters. When we interview designer and developer candidates for our clients, that’s applied to our normal rate. The client is responsible for finding the candidates themselves.</p>

<p>However, clients have asked us to help source candidates. So, we have the recruiting agreement which is a typical percentage of the new hire’s annual salary.</p>

<p>If you want to apply for a position with a client of ours, <span>contact us</span>.</p>

<h2 id="mutually_beneficial">Mutually beneficial</h2>

<p>A key word in our contracts and legal documents is “mutual.”</p>

<p>We offer our mutual NDA to potential clients who need an extra nudge before they’ll open up to strangers.</p>

<p>Our consulting contract says the client and developer mutually agree on a number of points, such as not using materials that break someone else’s copyright or publishing things to the web hosting provider that are abusive or unethical.</p>

<h2 id="signatures">Signatures</h2>

<p><span>RightSignature</span> ($14-$49/month) is an easy way to send contracts back and forth and get them signed without the “print and scan” process on either end. A printer/scanner costs a few hundred dollars if that factors into your decision.</p>

<h1 id="invoices">Invoices</h1>

<p>We use <span>Freshbooks</span> to invoice our consulting clients. It can do recurring invoices so we don’t forget to bill people at the end of the week. It automatically sends late payment notifications so we don’t have to have as many awkward conversations.</p>

<p>It has <span>many integrations</span> with services we use:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span>Shoeboxed</span> for <a href="#expenses">receipts</a>

<li>
<span>Highrise</span> for following up with contacts</li>

<p>It’s a one-click process to set up the MX records for your email’s <a href="#domain_names_ssl_certificates">domain name</a> using DNSimple. You’ll get some nice URLs like:</p>

<ul>
<li>mail.yourapp.com</li>

<h2 id="hotels">Hotels</h2>

<p>If you’re coming from out of town and only need to stay a few nights, we recommend these hotels:</p>

<p>Near the thoughtbot office, hip enough for a Rails developer:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>The Nine Zero</span></li>

<li><span>The Onyx</span></li>

<li><span>The Charlesmark</span></li>

<li><span>The Lenox</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Not as hip, but nearby location, best for hotels.com points, etc.:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Marriott Long Wharf</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Nearby, fancy enough for a venture capitalist:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Park Plaza</span></li>

<li><span>Ritz Carlton</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Park Plaza has a hard time filling up, so you can often get some last-minute $100/night deals. We recommend checking that one first, especially if you’re looking last-minute.</p>
